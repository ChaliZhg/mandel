In the script, a finite element solver to simulate poroelastic problems is developed and subsequently benchmarked by Mandels' problem. As the result shows, the pressure at the left end of the domain initially increases, before it later decreases to the final zero value, which is the so-called the Mandel-Cryer effect.
